# YelpCamp

This is the core project of WebDevBootCamp. This project covers an extensive number of topics taught in the bootcamp 
and I had a chance to directly implement them.

Using MEN stack (MongoDB, Express and Node.js), I have created a page to upload campgrounds using multiple topics covered in the course:
- Express and Node.js
- APIs
- Databases (MongoDB)
- Authentication
- RESTful routing
- Data Associations
- UI Improvements using Bootstrap

Even though all the topics covered in the bootcamp is integrated on this project, the visual improvement is still WIP.
