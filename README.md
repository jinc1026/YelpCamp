# YelpCamp

This is the core project of WebDevBootCamp. This project cover an extensive number of topics taught in the bootcamp 
and shows the actual use cases.

Using MEN stack (MongoDB, Express and Node.js), I have created a page to upload campgrounds using multiple topics covered in the course:
- Express and Node.js
- APIs
- Databases (MongoDB)
- Authentication
- RESTful routing
- Data Associations
- UI Improvements using Bootstrap

Even though all the topics covered in the bootcamp is integrated on this project, the visual improvement is still WIP.
